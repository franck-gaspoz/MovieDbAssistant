Schizophrenia causes delusions and hallucinations with paranoia. Many people used to believe that schizophrenia resulted in multiple personalities, but this is not the case. He should have been diagnosed with dissociative identity disorder (also known as multiple personality disorder). Further, there is no medication used to treat multiple personalities, although some medications can be used for other symptoms (such as anxiety and depression) that accompany the condition. Treatment of DID involves years of psychotherapy - the disorder cannot be cured by taking a pill as portrayed in the film.Hank Evans: You know, I think you're a very special unit.Irene P. Waters: That's sweet.Hank Evans: I hope we get to know each other better.Irene P. Waters: Yeah, me too.Hank Evans: Do you swallow?Under the credits, there are pictures of various featured extras identified by name.In a special edition release to home video in 2001, there were seven deleted scenes shown after the movie. The scenes were as follows:\na scene of the Colonel talking to Charlie/Hank who is taking a dump on his neighbor's lawn where Charlie/Hank also gives his opinion on an article in the newspaper, and it's being witnessed by Jamaal, Lee Harvey and Shonte Jr.;Charlie and Irene meet up with the owner of the cow they had tried to kill;while Irene is being interrogated, Charlie goes into his hotel room and takes out a watermelon and a photo of Irene and gets an idea; soon before Charlie and Irene leave the hotel room, a watermelon with a hole in it rolls out from under the bed;a comical sex scene;in the car, Irene hangs a mirror on the rear-view mirror, the sun shines through it and onto Whitey's hat, causing it to catch fire.
